=================

Goal
----

YunoHost is a **server operating system** aiming to make [self-hosting](selfhosting) accessible to as many people as possible, without taking away from the quality and reliability of the software. YunoHost supports [several kinds of hardware](install). It is based on and fully compatible with [Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org).

Origin
------

YunoHost was created in February 2012 after something like this:

 <blockquote><p>"Shit, I'm too lazy to reconfigure my mail server... Beudbeud, how were you able to get your little server running with LDAP?"</p>
<small>Kload, February 2012</small></blockquote>

All that was needed was an administration interface for Beudbeud's server to make something usable, so Kload decided to develop one. Finally, after automating several configurations and packaging in some web apps, YunoHost v1 was finished.

Noting the growing enthusiasm around YunoHost and around self-hosting in general, the original developers along with new contributors decided to start work on version 2, more extensible, more powerful, more easy-to-use, and one that makes a nice cup of fair-trade coffee for the elves of Lapland.

Name
----

**YunoHost** comes from the jargon "Y U NO Host". The [Internet meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme) should illustrate it:

Development
-----------

YunoHost is developed to be as **simple** and minimally-intrusive as possible, to retain compatibility with Debian. It merely proposes a package of automatic configurations for existing software, and is configurable via simple interfaces.

YunoHost is **entirely** a free software project. The philosophy of self-hosting is, to us, incompatible with any other model of software development.

Security
--------

The utmost effort is made to keep YunoHost secure, and **communications encrypted**. You can read more about this subject on the related page:

What YunoHost is not?
---------------------

Even if YunoHost can handle multiple domains and multiple users, it is **not meant to be a mutualized system**.

First, the software is too young, not tested at large scale and thus probably not optimized to be put in production for hundreds of users at the same time. With that said, we do not want to lead the software in that direction. Virtualization democratizes, and its usage is recommended since it is a more leaktight way to achieve mutualization than a "full-stack" system like YunoHost.

You can host your friends, your family and your company safely and with ease, but you must **trust your users**, and they must trust you above all. If you do want to provide YunoHost services for unknown persons anyway, a full VPS per user will be just fine, and we believe is a better way to go.
